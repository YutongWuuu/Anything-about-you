Big Brother Watch reveals that the government (not only in the UK) is taking ‘faceprints’ of millions of people for facial recognition. It seems that even we are the owner of our face, we can’t totally control where our facial data go. 

When Facial Recognition Technology (FRT) scan a face, it doesn’t record it as a picture, rather, it preserves a template of a face, and search for other personal information related.  The project displays a template face on a blue screen, which indicates a face after characterization in FRT. Usually, the most obvious information FRT get, also the most important information of a person regarded for power institutes, is political identities, such as gender, race, age, and class. These political categories put us into frames. We are losing diversity to express our identity. What if we don’t belong to any of these categories? I covered the real face with blue background, to only show the digital face, “the template face”, which can almost represent any human only takes the change of data. The template face floated on the screen, text flashes around it: It is someone “like” us, but is it really who we are?

Pressing the button, just like wiping a mirror. An alert “I am vast and complex” bumped out, the real self without any embellish appears, which is vivid and complex.
